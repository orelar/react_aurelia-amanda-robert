React Hooks have transformed how we handle state and side effects in React applications. I'll share what I've learned about the essential concepts of React Hooks, providing us with a clear understanding of this powerful feature.

### 1. Introduction to Hooks

   React Hooks are functions that allow functional components to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features. They were introduced in React 16.8 to enable stateful logic in functional components.

### 2. State Management with `useState`

   The `useState` Hook lets us add state to functional components. We can define and manage component-specific state variables, making it easier to handle user input and component updates.

### 3. Side Effects with `useEffect`

   The `useEffect` Hook is essential for managing side effects in our components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` and allows us to perform actions such as data fetching and DOM manipulation.

### 4. Custom Hooks

   Custom Hooks are a powerful way to reuse stateful logic across components. By extracting common logic into custom Hooks, us can share functionality and keep our codebase clean and maintainable.

### 5. Rules of Hooks

   To use Hooks correctly, we need to follow the Rules of Hooks. These rules ensure that Hooks are only called at the top level of our functional component or custom Hook, preventing issues with state and effects.
